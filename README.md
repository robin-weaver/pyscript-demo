# pyscript-demo
Demo web app using pyscript to model golf ball flight in 3 dimensions.

While modeling the flights of golf balls for another project, I decided to throw this into a quick little web app using [Pyscript](https://pyscript.net/), which runs python directly in your browser.
I'm not a UI designer, so it's not pretty. But it works!
